## Introduction
This data analysis project focuses on exploring data from a csv dataset using Python. 

The goal of this work is to explore and analyze the dataset to obtain valuable information about gym workouts.

The analysis process covers key steps such as data loading, data cleaning, data exploration, data analysis and data visualization using Python. 

## Goal
The ultimate goal of this project is to explore the csv file dataset to obtain all relevant information about a large collection of gym exercises.

Once the data is loaded, it will be cleaned and preprocessed to undergo univariate and bivariate exploration to then display and visualize the significant results obtained. 

Through the exploration and analysis of the data, it is expected to find answers to the following points:

* Most trained muscle groups
* Most frequently used equipment
* Most performed type of exercise
* Most frequent type of user: beginner, intermediate, or expert
* Most used muscle group and equipment in the different exercise types
* User segmentation

## Project overview
   1. Data loading
   2. Data cleaning: prepare the dataset for further exploration
   3. Data exploration:
      - Univariate analysis
      - Bivariate analysis
   5. Data visualization of the information obtained during the exploration
   6. Insights

## Dependencies
The following tools are necessary to carry out this project:

* Python 3
* Jupyter Notebooks
* Python libraries: 
    - Numpy
    - Pandas
    - Matplotlib.pyplot
    - Seaborn

## Technical skills
The following skills were used throughout the implementation of this project:

* Data loading
* Data cleaning
* Data exploration
* Data visualization

## Data set
The data for this analysis is loaded from a csv file which can be found uploaded in this repository.

The dataset consists of:
* 2918 entries
* 9 columns

## Data cleaning
Once the dataset was loaded, it was required to clean it to ensure its readability, comprehensibility, integrity and reliability. 

For this purpose, column names were modified to make them more informative and improve readability, and missing values, duplicates and outliers were properly handled. 

## Data exploration
To obtain useful information from this dataset, an in-depth exploratory analysis was carried out. The dataset was analyzed in a univariate and bivariate basis.

Univariate analysis involved analyzing each variable in the dataset separately.

The bivariate analysis consisted of examining two different variables to determine whether there is a dependence or relationship between them.

## Data visualization
Data visualization plays a crucial role in data analysis, as it is the stage at which the conclusions drawn from the analysis are effectively communicated.

This stage focuses on creating visual representations of the insights gained during the analysis. The Python libraries Matplotlib and Seaborn were used for this purpose.

## Insights
The project successfully analyzed a wide range of existing gym exercises.

As expected from this project, the following questions were answered:

### **Most trained muscle group**
The muscle groups that are trained the most are: abdominals, quadriceps and shoulders.

### **User segmentation**

* **Beginners:**
    - mainly perfom strenght exercises,
    - focus their training in: quads, chest and hamstrings, and
    - mostly use their own bodyweight and barbells.

* **Intermediate users:**
    - mainly train strength,
    - target: abdominals, quadriceps and shoulders, and
    - mostly use their own bodyweight and dumbbels.

* **Experts:**
    - focus on strength training,
    - their training targets mainly:quadriceps, abdominalss and lats, and
    - mostly use their own body weight and barbells.
